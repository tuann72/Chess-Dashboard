# Chess-Dashboard

## Goals

- Add addtional UI functionality such as the ability to search for another player without closing the application.
- Provide More Graph Options.
- Stylize the graphs more to make it seem more integrated with tkinter.
- Bugs
  - When closing the application, matplotlib continues to run (needs to be forced shutdown.)
  - If user has not ever played, it messes up with the plotting system of the PI chart (maybe insert default values to prevent this.)
